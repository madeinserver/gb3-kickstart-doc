<h1>Kickstart by Emergent Game Technologies</h1>

<p>Kickstart demonstrates Gamebryo LightSpeed best practices, provides samples that are easy to
follow and update, and includes useful library code in both C++ and scripting languages.</p>
<p>There are two parts to the Kickstart project:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Spark Library&mdash;provides basic services that are applicable to many different types of
    games. These services provide basic functionality and are designed to be extensible and modular.
    </li>
    <li>Samples (sometime referred to as GamePacks)&mdash;genre-specific examples that use the
    Spark Library. These give you an easy way to quickly prototype any type of game by starting
    with the appropriate sample. Alpha Game is the first Kickstart sample that is generally
    available. This sample is a simple third person perspective game that exposes the basics of
    cameras, input handling, and character controls. It has been organized to make it easy to
    create a new game using original art, level design, and character behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tutorials</h3>
<p>In order to better understand the Kickstart libraries, Emergent has provided a tutorial series for artists, designers, and programmer tutorials.</p>
