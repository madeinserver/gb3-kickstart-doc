<h1>Kickstart Samples</h1>

<p>Kickstart ships with two sample applications, AlphaGame and DayDreamer.  This page describes
each sample and lists the controls for the sample.</p>

<h3>Playing Alpha Game</h3>

<p>Alpha Game could be considered a "GamePack". It consists of an executable, art, code, and other 
data that together create a very simple 3rd-person walkaround scenario. Alpha Game is built from a 
game solution that currently includes AlphaGame.emtproj, SparkLibrary.emtproj, and a level file 
called AlphaGame.block. The solution also references the Gamebryo Standard Library, the PhysX 
Standard Library for trigger collision, and the Wwise Solution for 3D sound.</p>

<p>You run Alpha Game by double-clicking its executable: 
&lt;AlphaGame&gt;\Application\win32\AlphaGame_Release_&lt;VC80 or VC90&gt;.exe</p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
    <li>&lt;AlphaGame&gt; is the directory that contains your local copy of Alpha Game</li>
    <li>&lt;VC80 or VC90&gt; is shorthand for the version of Visual Studio that was used to compile 
    the executable </li>
</ul>

<p>The gameplay in AlphaGame is very simple. Using a standard Xbox controller on PC, you can:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Zoom the attached camera system in/out and around with the right analog stick (arrow keys 
    on keyboard).</li>
    <li>Move the player with the left analog stick (a,w,s,d keys on keyboard). Note that the 
    direction in which the character moves is relative to the position of the camera.</li>
    <li>The A button (spacebar on keyboard) is the "action" key. Currently, this is used to open 
    the treasure chest.</li>
    <li>The Start button (escape key on the keyboard) pauses and unpauses the game. Once paused, 
    the only action currently available is to unpause.</li>
    <li>Enemies patrol way points until they are within a certain distance of the player. Then they 
    pursue the player and explode if they touch him, doing damage.</li>
    <li>The game is won by reaching the end of the level and pressing the action button to open the 
    treasure chest.</li>
    <li>The game is lost if the player's health reaches zero.
    <li>There are also trigger and door examples placed thoughout the level.
    <li>Left shoulder button (LB) cycles through a series of performance tracker screens
    <li>Left trigger button (LT) dumps accumulated performance information to the log, and resets 
    the counters. The first time you press it it will include performance information gathered 
    during startup. Subsequent presses include information since the last press. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Playing DayDreamer</h3>

<p>DayDreamer could be considered a "GamePack". It consists of an executable, art, code, and 
other data that together create a simple over-the-shoulder perpective shooter. DayDreamer is 
built from a game solution that currently includes DayDreamer.emtproj, SparkLibrary.emtproj, 
and two level files. The solution also references the Gamebryo Standard Library, the PhysX Standard
Library for trigger collision, and the Wwise Solution for 3D sound. The Scaleform GFx library is 
also available although it is currently not being used.</p>

<p>You run DayDreamer by double-clicking its executable: 
&lt;DayDreamer&gt;\Application\win32\DayDreamer_Release_&lt;VC80 or VC90&gt;.exe</p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
    <li>&lt;DayDreamer&gt; is the directory that contains your local copy of DayDreamer</li>
    <li>&lt;VC80 or VC90&gt; is shorthand for the version of Visual Studio that was used to compile 
    the executable </li>
</ul>

<p>The controls for DayDreamer are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Move the player with the left analog stick (a,w,s,d keys on keyboard).</li>
    <li>Move the camera perspective and direction the player faces with the right analog stick, 
    mouse, or direction keys on keyboard</li>
    <li>Use the right mouse button to zoom</li>
    <li>Fire with the left mouse button or right trigger button</li>
    <li>Enable/Disable PhysX debug mode with F6</li>
    <li>Change weapons by the mouse scroll or the left and right shoulder buttons</li>
    <li>Press F3 to enter free-fly mode</li>
    <li>Press Space or the gamepad A button to jump</li>
    <li>Press "C" or the gamepad B button to crouch</li>
    <li>Press "U" or the gamepad Y button to activate items</li>
    <li>Press "Esc" or the gamepad Start button to bring up the menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that you must have ammunition to fire weapons other than the pistol. Ammunition pickups are 
scattered throughout the level. </p>
